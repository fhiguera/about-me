# Fernando Higuera
The world doesn’t wait for change—it demands bold leaders who dare to create it. I thrive at the intersection of innovation and impact, driving $1B+ in enterprise growth, boosting EBITDA by 5%, and transforming complexity into scalable outcomes. As the founder of a GenAI startup, I scaled multilingual AI systems to 15,000+ users, achieving a high-value exit that redefined market standards.

Beyond technology, my investments bridge progress with purpose. From advancing a [circular economy startup](https://loopdeco.com) to reviving a historic [winery](https://bodegasoutelo.com) in Spain, I believe innovation must serve something greater than itself. Whether reshaping industries or supporting groundbreaking [cancer research](https://www.pelotonia.org/profile/FH0025), my work is rooted in a singular goal: to leave a better world than the one we inherited.

Leadership is about more than delivering results—it’s about reimagining possibilities and building systems that stand the test of time. If the future belongs to bold ideas, then let’s create it together.
