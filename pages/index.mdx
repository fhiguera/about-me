# Fernando Higuera
Hello, I am a growth leader in information technology, e-commerce, and digital transformation. I am inspired and motivated by challenges and, as Barack Obama says, “the audacity of hope.”

My secret power is creating value and bringing structure and success to complex situations deemed impossible, transforming business cultures, building value, and driving growth.

You can find me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/iamfhiguera), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fhiguera/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fhiguera/), or at [f@fhiguera.com](mailto:f@fhiguera.com). Sometimes I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fhiguera). I also invest in cool things, like [wine](https://bodegasoutelo.com/).
